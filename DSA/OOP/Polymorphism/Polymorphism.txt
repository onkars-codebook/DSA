The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the 
ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. Real life example of polymorphism, 
a person at the same time can have different characteristic. Like a man at the same time is a father,
a husband, an employee.

polymorphism have follwing types :
    1) Run time polymorphism :
    - Method overriding 
    - When a method is called on a parent class reference holding a child class object,
      The method of the child class is executed, not the parent class method.
      This decision happens at runtime, based on the actual object.

    2) Compile Time polymorphism
    - method overloading 
    - The compiler determines which method to invoke by checking the method signature (method name, 
      number of parameters, type of parameters).
    - At compile time, the compiler decides which method() method to call.
