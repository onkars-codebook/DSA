In programming, a destructor is a method called when an object isdestroyed, typically to release
resources like memory, file handles,or network connections. In languages like C++, destructors are
explicitly used to manage resource cleanup.However, Java takes a different approach due to its 
automatic memory management system powered by garbage collection.
