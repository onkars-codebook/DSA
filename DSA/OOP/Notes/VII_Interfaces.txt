The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
By default, variables in an interface are public, static, and final.
It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritances in Java.
It is also used to achieve loose coupling.
In other words, interfaces primarily define methods that other classes must implement.
