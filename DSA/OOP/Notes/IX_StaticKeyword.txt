In Java, the super keyword is used to refer to the parent class (superclass). 

It has three main uses:

- Access Parent Class Methods – Calls an overridden method from the parent class using super.methodName().
- Access Parent Class Variables – Refers to a parent class field if a subclass has the same field name (super.variableName).
- Call Parent Class Constructor – Calls the parent class constructor using super() (must be the 
  first statement in a constructor).
