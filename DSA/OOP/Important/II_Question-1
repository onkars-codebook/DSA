Which of the following is a correct statement? (both classes in the same package)

java

class Vehicle { }
class Car extends Vehicle { }

a. Car c = new Car();  - right 

b. Vehicle v = new Vehicle();  - right

c. Vehicle v = new Car(); - right

d. Car c = new Vehicle()

Rule :

Parent refrence = child Object;
so option c is correct.
 

what is refrence - that stores the address of the object.
what  is object -  that actually stores.

class Vehicle {
    int a;
}
class Car extends Vehicle {
    int b;
}

Car c = new Vehicle();   // Here Car c is the refrence and the new Vechile forms an object, and allocating the 
// memory, so car class has property b, so c object can be able to access the all the properties in Vichle 
// but not in the Car.
Vehicle v = new Car(); // This will give the Runtime error, because vichle refrence will unable to assign 
//the Car.
